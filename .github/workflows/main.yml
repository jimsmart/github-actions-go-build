# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#     - master
#     - staging
#     - develop
#   pull_request:
#     branches:
#     - master
#     - staging
#     - develop

# Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events
on: [push, pull_request]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # The "build" workflow
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Install Go
    - name: Install Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: '1.16'
    
    # Install dependencies
    - name: Install dependencies

        go version

    #     SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }} # required
    #   if: always() # Pick up events even if the job fails or is canceled.

#   # The "deploy" workflow
#   deploy:

#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     needs: [build] # Only run this workflow when "build" workflow succeeds
